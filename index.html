						<h2>personal statement</h2>
						<p>
							My enthusiasm for applying creative strategy to business has manifested into various entrepreneurial ventures, including the development of a talent networking website and collaborating on the hashing out of start-ups. Through working on such projects I have enjoyed closely working with other people to accomplish overarching aims. I particularly enjoy consideration of data and insights to inform a strategy to a chosen goal. As well as my interest in business and strategy I also have a technological background which includes creating and reviewing HTML emails, creating Wordpress websites and managing commercial media for the TV and film industry. With my interest in seeing consumer sensitive campaigns from start to finish and ever relevant background in tech I believe I’d be a strong candidate for any working place. Furthermore I’m keen to develop my skill set and experience and so whilst my background may obviously lend itself to specific responsibilities, I embrace the prospect of new challenges which a foreign role may present. Am particularly keen to settle in a post which has scope for progression.
